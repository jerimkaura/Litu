#### Tech-stack

This project takes advantage of many popular libraries and tools of the Android ecosystem. Most of
the libraries are in the stable version.

* Tech-stack
    * [Jetpack Compose](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI.
    * [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
        + [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - To perform
          background operations
    * [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - For dependency injection
    * [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
        * [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) -
          Performs various actios when lifecycle state changes
        * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores
          and manages UI-related data
    * [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) for making network calls.
* Architecture
    * [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide?gclid=CjwKCAiAvaGRBhBlEiwAiY-yMLJgFw8dtzM8r78wKMlnykKhTDwh5vx4ZOGqGBbXQ8PEFlYsS_b_oBoCRGoQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
        - Makes it easier to write modular, reusable and easy to test code
    * [Android Architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture). An app architecture defines the boundaries between parts of the app and the responsibilities each part should have.
    * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
